Generate synthetic test input data for evaluating the following prompt:  

# **Prompt to test:** 
```markdown
{{prompt}}
```
--- 

Customization options:  
- Number of test cases: {{num}}
- Complexity level: {{complexity}}

Create a comprehensive synthetic dataset to test the prompt with. For example, if the prompt is about summarizing articles, you should generate mock articles as test cases. Ensure the generated inputs include a mix of typical and edge cases. If ambiguity exists in the given prompt, include test cases that highlight potential weaknesses. Return the {{num}} diverse example user-inputs in a list.
